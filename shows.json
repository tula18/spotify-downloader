        "description": "For thousands of years we\u2019ve pondered the meaning of dreams. Dreams offer insight into our subconscious. Dreams help us process emotions and organize our memories.  Most of us live our waking lives giving a sort of performance. Whether through dishonesty, embarrassment, or simply by being polite, there are thoughts we do not share.**Dreams have intrigued us for thousands of years. They provide a peek into our subconscious. They aid in managing emotions and arranging our memories.  We often perform in our awake state. We might be dishonest, embarrassed, or just polite. Thus, we keep some thoughts to ourselves.** Dreams, on the other hand, offer a platform where these suppressed thoughts can freely roam. They are the uncensored version of our minds, a place where our deepest desires, fears, and secrets can come to light without the fear of judgement or consequences.  Dreams also serve as a mirror, reflecting our inner state of mind. They can hint at unresolved issues, unfulfilled desires, or even potential future scenarios. They can act as a guide, helping us navigate through the labyrinth of our thoughts and emotions.  Moreover, dreams can be a source of inspiration. Many artists, writers, and scientists have reported getting brilliant ideas from their dreams. They can stimulate our creativity, encourage problem-solving, and even help us prepare for future events.  In conclusion, dreams are not just random images that appear during sleep. They are a powerful tool that our mind uses to process information, manage emotions, and explore the infinite possibilities of our imagination. They are an essential part of our cognitive and emotional well-being.  While you sleep, your inhibitions disappear. And you\u2019re left with the raw, unforgiving truth. The real you.  But dreams can be more than that.  Some claim dreams are the realm between ours and the spirit world. Some dreams can predict the future.  Studies have shown that dreams can be shared between people.  Lucid dreaming is when *you* \u2013 not your dreaming self, your conscious self - controls the dream. You are, literally, a God. The universe is your playground.  It\u2019s exhilarating and powerful. But there is a dark side.  What if: while lucid dreaming, *you* weren\u2019t in control of the dream? But, someone else was?\u00a0  That\u2019s no longer a dream, it\u2019s a nightmare. And it\u2019s no longer a playground \u2013 it\u2019s a prison.

        "html_description": "For thousands of years we\u2019ve pondered the meaning of dreams. Dreams offer insight into our subconscious. Dreams help us process emotions and organize our memories.<br /><br/><br /><br/>Most of us live our waking lives giving a sort of performance. Whether through dishonesty, embarrassment, or simply by being polite, there are thoughts we do not share.**Dreams have intrigued us for thousands of years. They provide a peek into our subconscious. They aid in managing emotions and arranging our memories.<br /><br/><br /><br/>We often perform in our awake state. We might be dishonest, embarrassed, or just polite. Thus, we keep some thoughts to ourselves.** Dreams, on the other hand, offer a platform where these suppressed thoughts can freely roam. They are the uncensored version of our minds, a place where our deepest desires, fears, and secrets can come to light without the fear of judgement or consequences.<br /><br/><br /><br/>Dreams also serve as a mirror, reflecting our inner state of mind. They can hint at unresolved issues, unfulfilled desires, or even potential future scenarios.

And a sizeable percentage of those sightings were hoaxers looking for attention.  The other 1% were classified as UFOs and sent on to Project Blue Book. What happened from there, McLeod didn't know. The fact that he was being sent to the other side of the country meant this sighting was important to the Air Force.  McLeod had a copy of the teletyped report from the UFO tracking office. It was stamped with an unusual \"Priority\" notification. It read:\u00a0  \"UFO landing with entities reported by missile technician in Tahoe NF, Sacramento. Orders: Investigate and contain via usual protocols ASAP.\"  McLeod's first step was to interview the witness. And, even after 17 years as an investigator, this was strangest UFO story he'd ever heard.",

It would take another 11 years for Congress to designate the Grand Canyon a national park.  Sensing a final opportunity for adventure, explorer G.E. Kincaid took a boat down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon. The canyon was rich in minerals like gold, silver and copper and Kincaid wanted to see what he could find before the area was closed off for good.  About 40 miles up-river from the El Tovar Crystal canyon, Kincaid saw stains in the sediment formation about 2,000 feet up. He tied off the boat and got out to investigate.  Kincaid couldn't find a trail, but after a short hike he found something interesting covered in desert brush. Steps. Hundreds of them. Carved in sandstone. Steps that wound their way up to a high shelf on the side of the canyon.  He followed the steps until he came across a cavern entrance. An entrance that was clearly man made.  Kincaid entered the cavern and turned on his flashlight.  On the walls he saw writing. But it wasn't English or Native American writing. It was Ancient Egyptian Heiroglypics.  Kincaid lifted his flashlight and saw that the tunnel ran far into the distance.  He didn't realize it at the time, but this was only the beginning.",

        "description": "In July 2008, the carcass of an animal washed up on the beach at Montauk Point Long Island. Local beachcombers are used to seeing dead animals. Seagulls, fish, crabs, even the occasional whale. But they had never seen anything like this. Animal experts were brought in to identify it. They were stumped. It looked like part dog, part reptile and part rodent - with the beak of a bird. This animal, whatever it was, became known as the Montauk Monster. But where did the Monster come from?  There could be only one answer. Plum Island. Plum Island is just a few miles from where the monster was found. Locals had heard rumors that this was a top-secret government facility that created bioweapons, engineered animal hybrids and maybe even experimented on people. Sounds like a wild theory. But then another animal washed up on the beach. Again, it couldn't be identified. And then another animal. And then two more. In 2010, the *rumors* about Plum Island seemed to be true when something else was found on the beach. This time it wasn't a strange animal. It was a body. A human body. Well... it was almost human.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

        "description": "The night after Christmas, 1980, was the last time Airman First Class John Burroughs would ever lead a normal life.  He was on patrol at an American-operated Woodbridge Air Force base in southern England. Woodbridge and nearby Bentwaters - called the Twin Bases were rumored to possess nuclear materials. This was the middle of the Cold War, and tensions were high.  The threat of nuclear attack, global escalation, and more, sat heavy on the shoulders of Burroughs and his fellow servicemen. But their job was simple: keep themselves, their nation, and their allies safe.  So, Burroughs conducted his nightly rounds, checking the perimeter for anything that threatened the peace. Suddenly, a bright light descended from the sky. Then another. Burroughs watched as the lights fell into the forest surrounding the base. When he and his team arrived to inspect the crash site, they were worried it was a Soviet incursion. But, what they found was far more terrifying than anything the Soviets could think of.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

You attend power-lunches with your agent. You pose for pictures on the red carpet on your way to collect your third Academy Award. Your life sounds fun. Wait, what? You're not a movie star? That's not your life? Well, maybe not in *this* universe, but there is a universe out there where your life is exactly as I described.  The \"Many Worlds\" or \"Multiple Universes\" theory says that anything that can possibly happen *does* happen. It just happens in a different reality that exists parallel to our own. There's a reality out there somewhere where you're a best-selling author. There's one where you're a Nobel Prize winning scientist who cured cancer. There's even a reality out there, where you're an evil dictator plotting to take over the world. And you enforce your will with an army of AI robots that you invented when you were a grad student at Stanford. Yes, some of these alternate realities are more far-fetched than others. But they *are* all out there. Scientists know how these realities are formed and people are working on technology to detect them.

You\u2019re a trapped animal in a cage: a virtual reality created more than 250,000 years ago for a single purpose: to use you as food. Your emotions are food for those who created the cage. Feelings of happiness and joy are digestible. But those emotions are nowhere near as nourishing as sadness, malice, and especially anger. Pain on a small scale is good, but pain due to war, famine, and pandemics? That\u2019s even better.  You\u2019re born, you grow, and you spend the first third of your life learning how to live in a society that barely knows you exist. Maybe you get married, have kids, maybe even grandkids.  Then, you die - and the pain ends. But death is just the beginning. Because now, you get to do it all over again.    ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

Shocked and confused, people sheepishly stepped outside to see what happened. Everything looked fine. They went back inside. But one woman wasn't satisfied. Cynthia Hind drove around the capital city of Harare, searching for the source of the sound but, nothing seemed unusual.  But back at home, Cynthia's phone rang relentlessly. She was a UFO investigator and witness reports were coming in one after another. The news claimed the sound was a sonic boom caused by a meteor shower. But Cynthia wasn't so sure. Eyewitnesses near Lake Kariba described bizarre lights in the sky earlier that week. Lights in a row that moved erratically: fast then slow. First north to south. Then east to southwest.

        "description": "Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Of his 13 movies a few are considered classics in their respective genres. Including the black comedy Dr. Strangelove, the highly-quotable anti-war commentary of Full Metal Jacket, and one of the most disturbing and enduring horror films of all time, The Shinning. But in 1968, Kubrick released \"2001 \u2013 A Space Odyssey\". This is more than a classic. It's a masterpiece. And widely regarded as one of the best science-fiction films of all time, and probably the most influential. This collaboration with science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke tells the story of an alien intelligence that visited Earth in the distant past, and left behind artifacts in the solar system.  The movie features groundbreaking special effects, which still hold up today. In fact, the effects looked so good, that the movie gave the American government an idea.  Billions of tax dollars were invested in the space program but the Soviets were still years ahead of the United States. NASA desperately needed to get to the moon before Russia, but they knew it was impossible. So they turned to one of the world's best filmmakers for help. Because when it came to the moon: if they couldn't make it, they'd fake it.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

He was heading to Yakima but took a slight detour to look for a lost US Marine Corps plane. If he could find it, he\u2019d collect a nice reward. Flying near Mount Rainier, he spotted a shiny object in his plane's mirror. Then, he saw multiple flashes of light. It looked like a group of aircraft, flying in formation. But something was wrong - these 'aircraft' didn't have tails. And they were flying faster than anything he\u2019d ever seen. After about two minutes, the objects vanished near Mount Adams.  When Kenneth landed in Yakima, he immediately told his friends and airport staff about his bizarre experience. By the time he reached Pendleton, Oregon, his story had spread. Reporters were eager to hear it.  In describing the odd movement of these objects, Kenneth said it was like a teacup saucer skipping across a lake. At that moment, the term \u201cflying saucer\u201d was born. And over the next two weeks, events would unfold that would affect every person on Earth.

        "description": "In December 1990, in a remote village above the Arctic Circle, two Russian scientists embarked on a daring experiment. Their goal was to enhance human \u201csuper-perception\u201d or ESP.  They built a device that could shield subjects from electromagnetic interference and amplify their biological energy. The device was a large tube of rolled aluminum with a chair inside.  As soon as the device was built, strange phenomena occurred around the village. Disc-shaped lights hovered around the lab. Balls of energy appeared and disappeared. The Northern Lights became so bright and vivid that they seemed to take physical shape.  Inside the lab, anyone who approached the device felt an unexplainable sense of dread. It took a while to persuade anyone to try it.  When the first subject finally sat in the chair, a flash of energy erupted that stunned everyone in the lab.  The device worked.  But it maybe worked a little *too* well.  Not only did it boost people\u2019s psychic abilities, it also enabled them to view any place in the world. And soon, they could view any place in time.  In fact, these experiments confirmed a theory first proposed in the 1950s.

Written in simple binary code, and using the most powerful radio telescope on the planet, the message was broadcast to a dense cluster of stars in the constellation of Hercules. This exercise was just ceremonial; a way to demonstrate new technology in radio astronomy. Nobody was really expected to receive it. And even if they did, it wouldn't be any time soon. The nearest star in the direction of the broadcast is 25,000 light-years away.  So, the telescope was tuned to 2380 Megherz, aimed at Hercules, and fired up. The scientists congratulated each other, shook hands, and went on with their lives. But 27 years later, something very unexpected happened with that message beamed into deep space.

Since the dawn of the atomic age, UFOs have been seen -- and photographed -- during nuclear weapons tests and near nuclear weapons facilities.  The Ark of the Covenant is one of the most mysterious artifacts in human history. The Ark, a sacred chest made of wood and covered in gold, has been missing since 587 BC. Its last known location was Jerusalem, somewhere under the Temple Mount. What does this have to do with UFOs? In 2011, a UFO was hovering over the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It emitted a flash of light, then shot straight up and disappeared into the night sky. This could be just a coincidence. But it could be that the craft was looking for the Ark. The Ark of the Covenant is an object of extreme religious importance to over 2 billion people. But why would a UFO be looking for it? Because it's the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction ever created.     ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

        "description": "On July 25th, a NASA scientist was studying images of a region of Mars called \"Cydonia\" when something caught his eye. He had to take a second to process what he was seeing. He grabbed a magnifying glass. There was no doubt. On the surface of Mars, 140 million miles from Earth, was a structure in the shape of a human face.  It was huge; about a mile wide; and showed two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Around the Face were pyramids and structures that didn't look natural. They look like they were built... by someone. The following day, NASA held a press conference. Of the thousands of photos sent back from Mars, all anyone asked about was The Face. Who built it and why? Is it a message from an advanced civilization now long extinct? Is it a religious artifact? Is it solid like the Great Sphinx? Or could it contain chambers like the Great Pyramid? Then NASA threw cold water on the speculation. They said there was a second photograph of the area taken shortly after. And that photo showed that the face was nothing more than an optical illusion. Small problem. That second photo doesn't exist. So why did NASA lie? The answer to *that* question is in the other pictures.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

They look up and see a creature: almost ten feet tall with massive wings perched on a high tree branch; staring at them with glowing red eyes. Then in an instant, it's gone. Three days later, just a few miles away, two young couples burst into the local police station. Terrified, they report being chased by a tall man with wings and glowing red eyes. More and more people would report seeing a creature that stood on two legs, was at least 8 feet tall, and had wings. Some said it was half-man, half-bird; others said half-man, half-bat. But that name that stuck was \"The Mothman\". Though The Mothman terrorized hundreds of people for a year, it never physically harmed anyone. But 13 months later, that would change. And 46 men, women, and children would end up at the bottom of the Ohio River.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

The seizures become violent. She thrashes around her bed for hours. You try to restrain her, but she suddenly has impossible strength. Her moods become erratic. She swings between fear and anger and sadness. Her speech becomes ragged and deep. She has sudden outbursts where she barks out phrases in Latin and Aramaic; languages she doesn't speak. Then, for no reason at all, the symptoms suddenly stop. And she's back to her normal self. Frightened and exhausted, but it's still her. Her doctor can't find anything wrong with her. Psychiatrists and neurologists can't explain what's happening. This scenario happens to hundreds of families every year from all over the world; of every different culture and religion.

        "description": "It's just a matter of time before it happens. Some catastrophic event that wipes out a large percentage of the Earth's population; and forces the human race to \"reset\". Maybe one of the 30,000 \"Near Earth Objects\" being tracked by NASA finally hit the Earth. Causing an extinction event on par with what wiped out the dinosaurs. Or Earth's poles finally shift. And, without its magnetic field, the planet is exposed to the raw destructive power of the Sun's radiation. Or maybe, on his deathbed, a dictator decides to go out in a blaze of glory; and launches his entire nuclear arsenal. It's just a matter of time before one of these, or one of another dozen doomsday scenarios plays out. And when that happens, world leaders like the President of the United States and Vice President will be immediately taken to underground facilities designed for this event. Key members of Congress and the military will also be taken to secure locations. But what about civilians? There ARE facilities around the world designed to house many thousands of people.

They're currently experimenting with brain implant technology. They've even explored genetic engineering to try and *breed* the perfect soldier. But those are nothing compared to what happened in 1983; when Lieutenant Colonel Wayne McDonnell submitted a very unusual and detailed report to US Army Intelligence. It was called \"Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process\". This is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve an out-of-body experience for the purpose of intelligence gathering. But Colonel McDonnell's report went much further than that. An advanced Gateway participant can not just project their consciousness to a different place; They could pull their consciousness completely out of this reality. They could travel anywhere in the universe, and at any point in time. The report revealed that our universe doesn't actually exist. It's a construct, created by our mind. By using the Gateway Process, you can exit the construct and see reality for what it really is. The 30-page Gateway report was immediately classified for one simple reason: anyone can learn to do it. Even you.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

If you're under 30, a cassette was how we listened to music in the stone age. Anyway, after being dropped, David's tape player would only play tapes in reverse. At first, he found this entertaining. There were lots of songs that contained hidden messages that you could only hear if you played them backward. But *those* messages were placed there intentionally. Soon, David discovered messages hidden in human speech that were NOT intentional. Messages that were put there by the speaker's subconscious. Turns out, we all do this. In fact, when we lie, our subconscious actually encodes the *truth*, backward, inside the lies that we tell. This is *really* interesting.

Borders between nations will be dissolved; all religions will be dismantled; and technology will be turned against us.</p><br/><p>The architects of Project Blue Beam will distract us with false flag operations like global pandemics, strange weather events, and news reports of UFOs being shot down all over the world.</p><br/><p>What&#39;s frightening is: the general population will go along with Project Blue Beam, willingly; without resistance.</p><br/><p>Even more frightening?</p><br/><p>It&#39;s already begun.</p><br/>--- <br/>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support</a>",

The officers asked the young man for identification. But, there were two problems with his ID. One, his documents were issued by the Soviet Union; which no longer existed. The second problem: according to his birth date, this *young* man was born in 1932.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

After a couple of failed attempts to get the car started, Janet was hit by a bright light. Bright enough that she had to shield her eyes.\u00a0 The light was coming from an apartment building. Janet thought maybe someone was shooting a movie. Not unusual in New York City.\u00a0 Then she saw that the light was coming from a saucer-shaped craft hovering *above* the building. OK, it's a science fiction movie, Janet thought. But it wasn't a movie. This was happening for real. As Janet's eyes adjusted to the brightness, she saw something levitating in the light. Objects floating up to the saucer. When she focused, she realized they weren't objects. They were people. Well, one of them was. In an instant, the light went out, and the saucer plunged into the East River. There were 23 eyewitnesses to this event, including one of the highest-ranking politicians in the world. And people being transported to a UFO by a beam of light in the middle of New York City? That isn't the weirdest part of the story.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

You see something out of the corner of your eye. You try to look but you can't move. You try to call out, but you're unable to make a sound. There's an invisible weight on your chest. Even breathing is difficult. You strain to look and then you see it. The shadow of a person. You can't detect any features but every instinct you have tells you: this is entity is not friendly. You hear a light hum, maybe a rush of air and the dark entity vanishes. You've just encountered a shadow person.\u00a0 This one was pretty benign, but there are some shadow people sightings that are more intense. More real. These encounters can be traumatic and in some cases: violent. I should know. Because it happened to me.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

        "description": "In 1908, President Teddy Roosevelt wanted to declare the Grand Canyon off-limits to all timber and mining operations. It would take another 11 years for Congress to designate the Grand Canyon a national park. Sensing a final opportunity for adventure, explorer G.E. Kincaid took a boat down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon. The canyon was rich in minerals like gold, silver and copper and Kincaid wanted to see what he could find before the area was closed off for good. About 40 miles up-river from the El Tovar Crystal canyon, Kincaid saw stains in the sediment formation about 2,000 feet up. He tied off the boat and got out to investigate. Kincaid couldn't find a trail, but after a short hike he found something interesting covered in desert brush. Steps. Hundreds of them. Carved in sandstone. Steps that wound their way up to a high shelf on the side of the canyon. He followed the steps until he came across a cavern entrance. An entrance that was clearly man made. Kincaid entered the cavern and turned on his flashlight. On the walls he saw writing. But it wasn't English or Native American writing. It was Ancient Egyptian Heiroglypics. Kincaid lifted his flashlight and saw that the tunnel ran far into the distance. He didn't realize it at the time, but this was only the beginning.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

They called a doctor who rushed over immediately. Dorothy's mother broke down when the doctor said there was nothing he could do. Her little girl was dead. The doctor left and returned an hour later with Dorothy's death certificate and gently discussed arrangements for the little girl's body. But during this conversation, shuffling was heard coming from Dorothy's room. They ran upstairs and there she was, playing in her room like nothing happened. The doctor examined her again. There was no sign of injury. He had no explanation. He said it appeared as if Dorothy had come back from the dead. He didn't realize how right he was.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

You get to experience the culture of an alien race, explore a new world; see and use technology that's 5,000 years ahead of ours. Would you do it? Before you answer, there are a few catches. You'll be gone for at least ten years. And when you return to Earth, all evidence of your existence will be erased. You have to start a new life, with a new identity; forbidden to tell anyone about what you experienced. Now would you do it? In 1965, 12 astronauts were sent to an alien planet as part of a human-alien exchange program. 13 years later the astronauts returned home. Well, most of them did. The mission commander wrote a 3,000-page report of everything his team experienced. First alien contact, the 40-light-year trip to the alien world, and everything that happened on the planet.

Finally, you go into the living room and you see it. In your mom's favorite chair, is a pile of smoldering ash. Completely unrecognizable as human. Just as you convince yourself that this isn't your mother, you see her jewelry in the gray dust. And then the grisly sight of your mother's feet, still in their slippers, on the floor by the ashes. There was a fire. An intense fire. But aside from her chair, nothing is burned. Even stranger, everything in the house is covered with a thin layer of pale yellow grease.

The code hidden within the Bible not only predicted Rabin's assassination, but also predicted the date, and even the name of the killer.

Lying in the smoldering grass, was a highly polished, metal sphere. This became known as the Betz sphere or the Betz orb. Terry Betz, Antoine and Jerri's 21-year-old son, went to pick up \u00a0the sphere. Although it was only 8-inches in diameter, it was extremely heavy. Then the Betz family did something with the sphere that would change their lives forever. Something that the family would come to regret.

It has the body of a man but the head of a dog or a wolf. Some call them werewolves. Others call them dogmen. Whatever they are, they've been terrifying people for hundreds of years.

The doorman of the Statler Hotel yelled to the lobby that there was a jumper. The night manager rushed out and saw him. A man, about 40 years old, lying on the pavement. He was on his back, wearing only his underwear and blood started to pool around him. 13 stories up, a single window was open; its curtain flapping through broken glass. The night manager knelt beside the man, whose eyes were open and was somehow still alive. He desperately tried to speak but was choking on blood and couldn't be understood. After a minute or two of trying to communicate, the man took a final deep breath and was gone. Nobody knows for sure what he was trying to say before he died. But one thing is for certain, it was something about the CIA.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

        "description": "SOUNDS FROM THE HOLE TO HELL \u00a0 In 1989, Dr. Dimitry Azacov and a group of scientists were working on a borehole drilling project in Siberia. \u00a0When the drill reached 14.4 kilometers, or 9 miles deep, the drill bit started rotating wildly. It had somehow broken through solid rock and into a hollow area under the earth's crust. This cavity wasn't supposed to be there. \u00a0 When the drill returned to the surface, it was literally glowing red hot. This, also, was unexpected. The temperatures at these depths should be about 100 degrees. 150 degrees at most. \u00a0Instruments were reading temperatures of over 1,100 degrees. \u00a0Dr. Azacov said, \"It seems like an inferno in the center of the Earth\". \u00a0 The next discovery, according to Dr. Azacov, was the most shocking; and caused some people to leave the project. \u00a0At the surface, they heard strange sounds coming from the hole. At first, the engineers thought it was their equipment. So they shut down all the machinery, but the sound was still there. \u00a0 Part of the research done at the site was recording the sound of the movement of the earth using specialized microphones. \u00a0\u00a0 So they lowered one of these microphones into the hole. Even though it was designed to operate at high temperatures, it overheated in just a few seconds. \u00a0But a few seconds was enough to prove the sound was definitely coming from the Earth's interior. He said the sound was unsettling. \u00a0 9 miles below the surface, in a superheated cavern, they heard humans voice screaming in pain. \u00a0 Let's find out why.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

The temperatures at these depths should be about 100 degrees. 150 degrees at most. \u00a0Instruments were reading temperatures of over 1,100 degrees. \u00a0Dr. Azacov said, &#34;It seems like an inferno in the center of the Earth&#34;. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The next discovery, according to Dr. Azacov, was the most shocking; and caused some people to leave the project. \u00a0At the surface, they heard strange sounds coming from the hole. At first, the engineers thought it was their equipment. So they shut down all the machinery, but the sound was still there. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Part of the research done at the site was recording the sound of the movement of the earth using specialized microphones. \u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>So they lowered one of these microphones into the hole. Even though it was designed to operate at high temperatures, it overheated in just a few seconds. \u00a0But a few seconds was enough to prove the sound was definitely coming from the Earth&#39;s interior. He said the sound was unsettling. \u00a0</p><br/><p>9 miles below the surface, in a superheated cavern, they heard humans voice screaming in pain. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Let&#39;s find out why.</p><br/>--- <br/>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support</a>",

You're with a trusted friend; maybe on a hike, or sitting in a bar or just hanging out. Out of nowhere, your friend asks you: \"Can you keep a secret?\" Of course you reply that you can. \u00a0 Your friend hands you a small black sleeve, about the size of a credit card.

And Titanpointe is a core location used for a controversial, and possibly illegal, NSA-sponsored mass surveillance program. According to leaked documents, this program has targeted the communications of the UN, the World Bank, the IMF. It's been used to spy on at least 38 countries, including US allies like France, Germany and Japan. \u00a0 It's common knowledge that AT&T is very cooperative with the NSA. Using an AT&T cell phone?

Local teens were suffering from amnesia and having hallucinations.

If you believe the predictions of Nostradamus and you enjoyed 2020, you're gonna *love* 2021. \u00a0While many astrologers, seers and mystics are predicting a hopeful future. If you believe Nostradamus, you better start kissing your mommies and saying your goodbyes. \u00a0 He predicted that 2020 would be a \"great trouble for humanity\". Well, that was true. And he says a greater trouble is coming in the form of a global famine. According to Nostradamus, the famine will be the worst the world has ever faced and will ultimately end in a disruption of social hierarchies and state power. \u00a0 Nostradamus predicted solar storms will take place. He said: \"We shall see the water rising and the earth falling under it\". \u00a0\u00a0Then he predicts a comet or asteroid will hit the earth or come very close to striking the planet which will cause earthquakes and other natural disasters: \"In the sky, one sees fire and a long trail of sparks.\" \u00a0 FYI, we did have a few close calls with asteroids this past year. And NASA's automated asteroid watching system -- called Sentry -- is currently tracking asteroid 2009 JF1. JF1 is around 130 meters in diameter. About the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. This could hit Earth in 2022. \u00a0 Nostradamus predicted a great calamity would shake through the New World in the \"Lands of the West\" causing it to fall into the ocean. This is thought to be California. He suggested that this great calamity will happen when \"Mercury in Sagittarius, Saturn fading\". The date when Mars and Saturn will be in those exact positions in the sky is Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 2021. \u00a0 And the last prediction is a doozie.

It's so unnerving, that the significance of the horrifying sound of the Aztec Death Whistle has fascinated and perplexed scholars for years. \u00a0I'm going to play the sound of the Aztec Death Whistle for you today. \u00a0 When Spanish conquistador Cort\u00e9s and his men arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in 1521, they described witnessing a gruesome ceremony. Aztec priests, using razor-sharp obsidian blades, sliced open the chests of sacrificial victims and offered their still-beating hearts to the gods. They then tossed the victims' lifeless bodies down the steps of the Great Temple known as Templo Mayor; in Mexico City. \u00a0 Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, also a conquistador, described two rounded towers flanking the Templo Mayor made entirely of human skulls. And between them, a *huge* wooden rack displaying thousands more skulls with holes bored through either side to allow them to slide onto the wooden poles. \u00a0 Reading these accounts hundreds of years later, many historians dismissed the 16th-century reports as wildly exaggerated. \u00a0 *But* over just the past few years, archeologists working at the Templo Mayor excavation site discovered *proof* of widespread human sacrifice among the Aztecs. And the proof was *none other* than the very skull towers and skull racks that the conquistadors had described centuries ago. \u00a0 The Aztec Death Whistle has been described as sounding like humans howling in pain, or as one researcher said, the 'scream of a thousand corpses'. \u00a0 Let's find out why.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

It&#39;s so unnerving, that the significance of the horrifying sound of the Aztec Death Whistle has fascinated and perplexed scholars for years. \u00a0I&#39;m going to play the sound of the Aztec Death Whistle for you today. \u00a0</p><br/><p>When Spanish conquistador Cort\u00e9s and his men arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in 1521, they described witnessing a gruesome ceremony. Aztec priests, using razor-sharp obsidian blades, sliced open the chests of sacrificial victims and offered their still-beating hearts to the gods. They then tossed the victims&#39; lifeless bodies down the steps of the Great Temple known as Templo Mayor; in Mexico City. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, also a conquistador, described two rounded towers flanking the Templo Mayor made entirely of human skulls. And between them, a *huge* wooden rack displaying thousands more skulls with holes bored through either side to allow them to slide onto the wooden poles. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Reading these accounts hundreds of years later, many historians dismissed the 16th-century reports as wildly exaggerated. \u00a0</p><br/><p>*But* over just the past few years, archeologists working at the Templo Mayor excavation site discovered *proof* of widespread human sacrifice among the Aztecs. And the proof was *none other* than the very skull towers and skull racks that the conquistadors had described centuries ago. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The Aztec Death Whistle has been described as sounding like humans howling in pain, or as one researcher said, the &#39;scream of a thousand corpses&#39;. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Let&#39;s find out why.</p><br/>--- <br/>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support</a>",

The experiment had disastrous consequences for the crew of the USS Eldridge. \u00a0 In the summer of 1943, two years after the US entered World War II, American destroyers were being decimated by the infamous German U-boat submarines and German mines were making combat... and commerce dangerous enterprises. \u00a0 The United States Navy knew something had to be done. \u00a0 A few months later, on October 28th, 1943, the USS Eldridge, a Cannon-class destroyer, was docked in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. And the Eldridge held some secrets. \u00a0It was a newly commissioned vessel that was equipped with several large generators as part of a top-secret mission to win the Battle of the Atlantic once and for all. \u00a0Rumor aboard the ship was that the generators were designed to power a new kind of magnetic field that would make the warship invisible to enemy radar and undetectable to enemy mines. \u00a0 With the full crew on board, it was time to test the system. In broad daylight, and in plain sight of nearby ships, the switches were thrown on the powerful generators, which hummed to life. \u00a0What happened next was unexpected. And it would baffle scientists and fuel decades of speculation. Witnesses described a murky green fog that surrounded the entire hull of the ship; and then swallowed it whole. \u00a0\u00a0 When the fog faded away seconds later, the USS Eldridge... was gone. It wasn't just invisible to military radar. It was invisible to everyone. It was gone... \u00a0That is, until it mysteriously turned up in Norfolk, Virginia. That's a distance of about 250 miles. \u00a0\u00a0 And the strangest part? When it arrived in Norfolk \u2013 it was ten minutes earlier in the day than when it disappeared from Philadelphia. \u00a0The Eldridge then reappeared in Philadelphia twenty minutes later. Or, uh, ten minutes later? Because of the whole, uh, time travel thing? Hard to tell. Either way, it came back. \u00a0\u00a0 But something had gone terribly wrong. \u00a0According to reports, when the ship rematerialized, members of the Eldridge crew suffered from terrible burns and disorientation. And some of its crew had been fused into the metal walls at the molecular level. They were unable to move. Unable to free their skin from the metal that it clung to; and died in agony. \u00a0\u00a0 Other crew members went insane. And some of the crew?

Did you know there is a similar place in Nevada? The Nevada Triangle. In a region of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Nevada and California, 2,000 planes have been lost in the last 60 years. In this remotely populated area of more than 25,000 miles of mountain desert, many of the crash sites have never been found. \u00a0 The Nevada Triangle is typically defined as spanning from Las Vegas, Nevada in the southeast to Fresno, California in the west, and to Reno, Nevada at the top. Within this wilderness is the mysterious, top-secret Area 51. Along with the dozens of conspiracy theories which include UFOs and paranormal activity that surrounds the air force base, similar theories have long been considered regarding the Nevada Triangle. \u00a0 One plane to go missing was that of a record-setting aviator, sailor, and adventurer named Steve Fossett on September 3, 2007. Fossett, flying a single-engine plane over Nevada's Great Basin Desert, took off and never returned. After hunting for a month for the plane, the search was called off and on February 15, 2008, Fossett was declared dead. Later that year on September 29th, Fossett's identification cards were discovered in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California by a hiker. \u00a0 Throughout the years, many of the missing planes were flown by experienced pilots and have disappeared under mysterious circumstances: and their wreckage never found. \u00a0The biggest mystery is: nobody really talks about it. \u00a0 Let's find out why.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

Now, a researcher in Germany has claimed to have finally decoded the most mysterious book in the world. \u00a0 The Voynich Manuscript is a 240-page medieval codex written in an indecipherable language, full of bizarre drawings of strange plants, astrological symbols and... lots of... naked women. \u00a0 The Voynich Manuscript defies classification and has also defied comprehension. Cryptologists, FBI operatives, respected medievalists, mathematic and scientific scholars, skilled linguists... they've all been left stumped. Even Alan Turing took a crack at it and came up short. \u00a0 It's written from left to right and although it's never been \"officially\" deciphered, there's definitely a structure to it. Researchers have concluded that the language has 20 to 25 distinct letters but nobody has been able to figure out how the letters fit together. \u00a0\u00a0 According to cryptanalyst Elizabeth Friedman in 1962, anyone who attempts to translate it is \"doomed to utter frustration.\" \u00a0 Let's find out why.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support",

Now, a researcher in Germany has claimed to have finally decoded the most mysterious book in the world. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The Voynich Manuscript is a 240-page medieval codex written in an indecipherable language, full of bizarre drawings of strange plants, astrological symbols and... lots of... naked women. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The Voynich Manuscript defies classification and has also defied comprehension. Cryptologists, FBI operatives, respected medievalists, mathematic and scientific scholars, skilled linguists... they&#39;ve all been left stumped. Even Alan Turing took a crack at it and came up short. \u00a0</p><br/><p>It&#39;s written from left to right and although it&#39;s never been &#34;officially&#34; deciphered, there&#39;s definitely a structure to it. Researchers have concluded that the language has 20 to 25 distinct letters but nobody has been able to figure out how the letters fit together. \u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>According to cryptanalyst Elizabeth Friedman in 1962, anyone who attempts to translate it is &#34;doomed to utter frustration.&#34; \u00a0</p><br/><p>Let&#39;s find out why.</p><br/>--- <br/>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thewhyfiles/support</a>",
